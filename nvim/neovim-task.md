### File Navigation

I have too many ways to navigate now. Need to improve the workflow

1. MiniFiles (Oil.nvim previously)
2. MiniPick (Fuzzy finder)
3. Also have Snacks.Picker
4. Arrow.nvim (Barely use it nowadays)

### Git

I should learn to use the MiniGit(Fugitive) workflow, and MiniDiff
I rely on LazyGit a bit too much.

### LSP

Don't have a good LSP setup yet, I have LSPs installed via mason, have Blink.cmp
for suggestions, have setup keybinds using MiniPick for lsp actions. Also have
trouble.nvim installed for diagnostics, document symbols etc

### Buffer navigations

I use c-d/c-u a bit too much to scroll. Should use Mini.Jump2d too

### Plugins

Don't Fully utilize the modules/plugins from snacks.nvim and mini.nvim plugins
fully.

### Command line

I also use Yazi a bit too much on the commandline, I should use default cd, mv,
rm, cp, ls, mkdir, touch etc to navigate the directories
