/*
LF file manager config

Install LF fork from "https://github.com/horriblename/lf"

Compile CTPV from "https://github.com/NikitaIvanovV/ctpv"
will need libcrypto and libmagic libraries to compile

Also Check out https://github.com/horriblename/lfimg-sixel for image previews

pip install libssl-dev
pip install libmagic-dev

Install Glow package to view .md file in lf
https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow


UPDATE:
No need to do any of the above things

LF now has sixel support built into it, lfimg-sixel fork is not needed 
And also ctpv is not need to prview images

Just set the preview to preview script
Get the preview script from the ctpv repo

and add `set sixel true` in lfrc

I will soon update the LfInstall script
